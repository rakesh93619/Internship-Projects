Hootananny is located right next to two bus stops with 24-hour connections to the city centre.\\n\\nHostellers are treated to a 20% discount on drinks at the award-winning bar downstairs that was recently crowned Best Live Music venue in London. Festival headliner Manu Chao chose Hootananny bar to give a secret show after his festival performance, and Hootananny star gigs include big gypsy bands, hip hop, dubstep, afrobeat, live reggae acts from Jamaica, ska, world music and indie rock.\\n\\nImportant\\n- Staff reductions in recent times have affected the check-in window on weekends. Staff will no be on site until after 2pm\\n- Please be aware that you must present photo I.D. when you arrive. We only accept passports or a driving license as valid I.D. This is a hostel for over 18s only, there are no family rooms and we do not cater for young children.\\n- The hostel is located above a live music venue, and music can be heard throughout the hostel until fairly late on Friday and Saturday nights. This does not prove to be a problem for many of our guests, but we can provide you with earplugs if you would like to ensure a good night's sleep.\\n- Reception is open from 9am - 12 midnight. Check-in time is after midday, but if you arrive early you can always relax in our lounge room or use the amenities.\\n- Check-out time before 11am.\\n- Bookings for groups of 4 or more require pre approval from the property and full payment in advance.\\n- We are a backpackers hostel and do not check in local residents of London into our hostel.\\n\\nHappy travels!\",\n",
       " \"The Green Man Bestplace Inn is next door to Edgware Rd tube station, connecting travellers directly to Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, the Embankment, King's Cross Station and more, making it convenient for getting around the city as well as going to and from the airport. We like that the pub downstairs is open 24hrs for residents and has karaoke and highly-rated pizza. Our guests say they appreciate the 'very clean' hot showers, comfy beds and sociable staff.\"]"
